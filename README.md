# Karuta cards

This is a project aiming to recreate a deck of cards used in traditional Japanese game called [Karuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uta-garuta).
A complete set of cards contains 100 cards, each featuring a poem from Hyakunin Isshu, a collection of poems composed in the Heian period.

This is a work in progress!
